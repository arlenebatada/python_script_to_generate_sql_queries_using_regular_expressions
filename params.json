{"name":"Python script to generate sql queries using regular expressions","tagline":"","body":"# python_script_to_generate_sql_queries_using_regular_expressions\r\nIn the process of creating MANAS, we came across a problem where we needed to enter a lot of data into the database. The problem was that it is impossible for a human to collect the data and enter that huge amount of data in the database. So, we created this python script which takes the data in tabular form, collected from gtuinfo, use the same data and append some other random data to it, and generate the sql scripts. This python script takes data from \"table of colleges with other information.txt\", generates text files named \"branchessql.txt\", \"collegebranchessql.txt\", \"collegescoresql.txt\", \"collegessql.txt\", \"locations.txt\", each containing sql queries generated by the script for the relevant tables in the database. We are hereby licencing it with MIT License whereby anyone can study this code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
