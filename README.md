In the process of creating MANAS (our final year project), we came across a problem where we had to enter a lot of data into the database. The problem was, that it is impossible for a human to collect the data and enter that huge amount of data in the database. So we created this python script which takes the data collected in tabular form from gtuinfo, appends some other random data to it, and finally generates the required sql scripts. This python script takes data from "table of colleges with other information.txt", generates text files named "branchessql.txt", "collegebranchessql.txt", "collegescoresql.txt", "collegessql.txt", "locations.txt", each containing sql queries generated by the python script. All the newly generated text files are named after the relevant tables in our database. We are licensing it with MIT License whereby anyone can study this code.
