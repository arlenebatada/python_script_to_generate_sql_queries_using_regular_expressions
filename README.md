•	Suppose you wish to create folders named from A to Z (1st level), add another folders named from A-Z in A, and also add folders named from A-Z in B and so on up to Z (2nd level). What if you wish to create such 26 folders up to n levels? Creating them manually would be practically insane. This problem is not an imaginary one, rather has showed up in real life in an event named "e treasure hunt" in my college. For this hunt lot of stuff was needed to be hidden amongst this large number of folders from where the participants had to search the required stuff, provided some clues. So, I thought of creating this program which creates these folders up to the ‘n’ number of levels- the number which the user enters.
